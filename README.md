# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-Swin-V2-Transformers-and-CNNs
This repository implements a hybrid brain tumor segmentation model that combines Swin V2 transformer blocks with convolutional encoder–decoder components and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). The network is trained and fine-tuned on the BraTS 2020 dataset to segment
