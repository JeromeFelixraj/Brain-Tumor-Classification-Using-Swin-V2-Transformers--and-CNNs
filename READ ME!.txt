About our model:
  
   This project uses a hybrid deep learning model combining a Swin V2-Large Transformer with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify brain tumors from MRI images. Trained on 5712 high-quality scans and tested on 1300 separate images, the model identifies four tumor types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. After 7 epochs, it achieved around 96.8% test accuracy, showcasing strong generalization performance. A user-friendly PyQt5 interface allows real-time predictions through simple drag-and-drop functionality
